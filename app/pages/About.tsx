            His writing experience stems from 2015 with the establishment of his
            Tumblr blog www.smileythevisionaire.tumblr.com where he wrote music
            reviews, event reviews, as well as artist & brand profiles. Prior to
            that, Lungelo was a Rapper and Songwriter since his early teens, so
            make no mistake; that boy can write. Soon after dropping out of
            College, Lungelo Zulu started his own content production agency
            called HIP Daily Media Works. The agency&apos;s first target was
            Sunday Kos & Chill, a gala dinner with friends &apos;cause, of
            course, Lu is friends with many, many artists, across various
            mediums, so best believe, this bloke knows every-one. This gala
            dinner was the official launch of the company HIP Daily Media Works,
            a company that would soon launch Sithi No More Femicide: A War
            Against A War, a short socio-commentary piece written and produced
            by Lungelo Zulu himself. This project, as Lungelo&apos;s first
            attempt at a documentary probed the intricate effects of patriarchy
            in modern society through the understanding of five young women
            majoring in Rugby, Beauty, Art and Student Relations.

            Word on the street has it that Lungelo is returning fully to his
            initial duties at HIP Daily Media Works as Creative Director & Head
            of Content and has a possible docuseries in the pipelines. The first
            installation is set to premiere on the 5th of August via HIP Daily
